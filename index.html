<ul>
<li> The aim of speculative philosophy is to develop a "coherent, logical, necessary system of general ideas" which can interpret the elements of our experience. </li>
<li> There are elements which make up our experience. Such elements include feelings, changes, perception and others. </li> 
<li> Every experience occurring would be a particular instance of this system of general ideas. </li>
<li> The system would provide a wholesome framework to grasp the experience and its elements fully. </li>
<li> The system has: 
<ul>
<li> Rational side: 
<ul>
<li> It is coherent.
</li>
<li> It is logical.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Empirical side: 
<ul>
<li> It is applicable.
</li>
<li> It is adequate.

<ul>
<li> Coherence:  
<ul> 
<li>Fundamental ideas which build the scheme presuppose each other. In isolation, a fundamental idea of the scheme has no meaning. 
</li>
<li> Fundamental ideas of the scheme cannot be defined in terms of each other. They cannot be abstracted from each other. 
</li>
<li> <i> "In other words, it is presupposed that no entity can be conceived in complete abstraction from the system of the universe and that it is the business of speculative philosophy to exhibit this truth." </i>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Logical:
<ul>
<li> There is no contradiction in the scheme.</li>
<li> Elements of the scheme can be defined in logical terms.</li>
<li> The general logical notions are exemplified in instances of the scheme.</li>
<li> Principles of inference are followed. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Necessary:
<ul>
<li> In all experiences, the scheme is instantiated. It is universal.</li>
<li> In these experiences, there is communication with "immediate matters of fact".<sub> Refer to Glossary for: notions of communication, immediacy and matter-of-fact.</sub></li>
<li> That which is not communicated in immediacy is not knowable and thus, not known. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<td>There is an essence to the universe. This essence is expressed through the characteristic of necessity in universality. Such an essence does not admit relationships beyond the universe. Such a relationship would be the violation of its rationality.</td>
