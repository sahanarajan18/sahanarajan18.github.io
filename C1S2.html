Weakness of Insight:
<ul list-style-type: "square">
<li>Lack of clear-cut analysis of immediate experience: The actual world is our primary datum. This includes ourselves. This world is accessible to us through immediate experience. However, there is no clear and distinct analysis of this immediate experience. Such an analysis would include the details which would enable us to grasp the experience <i>with definiteness/definity.</i></li>
<li>Weak observation: We access the world around us generally through the method of difference. When an object is present, it is captured through observation. However, in its absence, it is not integrated within one's thought. This shows the lack of ability to holistically encapsulate the elements of our immediate experience. A hint for why there is such a lack is the repetitive, stagnant habituation to our ways of looking at the world, which weakens our observation.</li></li>
<li>Imaginative stagnation through habitual use of method of difference: Echoeing the previous point (and applying it to faculty of imagination this time), our imaginative abilities rust due to the lack of its application. Imagination is not applied because of the mentioned reason, the habituation to method of difference and its impact on observation. That which does not enter the scope of our observation also remains out of the scope of our imagination. </li>

Deficiencies of Language: The language we use for ordinary usage has to be stretched in order to record metaphysical examinations. However, even after such a stretch, they not only become foreign to their common-sensical use but remain "metaphors mutely appealing for an imaginative leap".</li>

Some reasons for success of imaginative rationalization is:
<ul list-style-type="circle">
<li> Active Use of Imagination: There are many factors of our immediate experience which are neglected by our observation. When imagination operates, it can attend to them. 
</li>
<li> Negative Judgment: <br>
<i> "The negative judgment is the peak of mentality."</i> <br>
In imagination, one can involve with inconsistencies and that which is not persistent in order to better understand and grasp consistency and persistence that characterises the actual world.

Step-by-Step Guide to Imaginative Rationalization/Construction:
<ol type="I">
<li> The Ground of Particular Observation: The starting point is to pay attention to the insights of other studies of human experience, including physics, physiology, psychology, aesethetics, ethical beliefs, sociology, languages and others. Such insights reflect their limited application. 
</li>
<li> Method of Generalization: Once you have the insights from particular studies, consider their application beyond their current scope.The success of Imaginative Rationalization is in its ability to apply results of the particular studies beyong their originating locus. This is the process of philosophic generalization. However, this does not imply an unqualified generalization- it is the job of imagination and consequent rationalization to discern the applicable insights and to integrate them adequately in order to prepare them for application to the larger locus. 
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li> Philosophic generalization is "the utilization of specific notions, applying to a restricted group of facts, for the divination of the generic notions which apply to all facts."
</li>
<li> Natural Science possesses the characteristics of both rationalism and irrationalism. 
<ul list-style-type:"square">
<li> Rationalism: Within its borders, natural science follows rationalism. 
</li>
<li> Irrationalism: Beyond its borders, it tends to be irrational. Why? Because it often refuses to accept that there are "factors in the world not fully expressible in terms of its own primary notions devoid of further generalization". That is, there are phenomenon in the world which is not within the scope of application of natural science and it does not accept such a limitation. In refusing to accept its limitation, thought denies itself- that is, the very be-ing of thought is not within the scope of natural science and in thinking that everything is, natural science has denied the very faculty it utilizes for such an assertion. 
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Obedience of Rationalistic Ideals of Coherence and Logical Perfection:  
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
<li> Coherence: Incoherence is "the arbitrary diconnection of first principles". While proponents of a system expect of their opponents to be rigorously coherent, they often compromise on the "rationalistic sanity" of their own systems. Initially, the criticisms received by a system could be ignored as trivial; however, over time, as it is received with authority and acquires orthodoxy, the incoherences are not tolerated. Consider the case of Descartes' philosophy. Why are there two substances? Why not one-substance world, the only-physical or only-mental? This is an incoherence in his system.  Corporeality and mentality are connected in matters of fact, in ways which his system does not capture (the classic mind-body issue). Though the Cartesian system says something true, the notions are too abstract and do not access the nature of things. 
</li>
<li> Logical perfection: The notions presuppose each other in a system. Logical perfection can be grasped through the example of mathematics in natural science. Mathematics show how special notions, observed in specific instances can be generalized.

<th> Spinoza's Philosophy
</th>

<td>
<center>Descartes to Spinoza || No subject-predicate form in Whitehead's system || Spinoza's Modes are Whitehead's actualities</center> <br>
Spinoza modifies Descartes' system and makes it more coherent. It begins with one substance along with its essential attributes and individualized modes. The incoherence of this system is that the notion of modes is arbitrary. However, one must admit that any account of the experienced world cannot do without a multiplicity of modes. <br>
Though there are much affinity between Whitehead's and Spinoza's system, the primary difference is that Whitehead does away with the subject-predicate form of thought. The subject-predicate form is not "a direct embodiment of the most ultimate characterization of fact". In Whitehead's system, the subject-quality concept is replaced with the category of dynamic process. <br>
Also, the modes of Spinoza's system become the actualities in Whitehead's. There is no going behind the modes to discover some higher grade of reality. The coherence of Whitehead's system is in finding out concrescence, that is, discovering that the process of an actual entity involves all other actual entities in its components. This explicates the solidarity of our world.

<th> The Ultimate
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
In most philosophical systems, there is an ultimate. Such an ultimate is actual owing to its accidents. Why is it that the ultimate is actual in virtue of its accidents? This can be understood in light of the following that Whitehead says on P.344:<br>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li> <i> But of course, there is no meaning to 'creativity' apart from its "creatures" and no meaning to 'God' apart from the creativity and the "temporal creatures" and no meaning to the temporal creatures apart from "creativity" and "God". </i>
</li>
</ul>
The ultimate is God or "The Absolute" in Spinoza's system and many other monistic philosophies. However, in these systems, the Absolute is deemed as possessing finality/a final reality or an eminent reality. Such reality is possessed by the Absolute, beyond its embodiment through its accidents. Such finality is not present in Whitehead's notion of the ultimate, in notion of creativity. <br>
In Whitehead's system, the ultimate is <i> creativity </i>.<sub> Check Glossary for definition of creativity.</sub>. Whitehead's system is closer to Asiatic and European thought in its distance from the notion of finality. Such systems consider the process to be ultimate while the "other side" (western) considers the fact to be ultimate.
