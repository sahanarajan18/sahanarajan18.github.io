Validity of Philosophical Systems 
</th>

<tr>
<td>
When there is a paradigmatic shift in philosophy, a system is dethroned from its position of authority and another is acknowledged. However, all the philosophical systems which have originated and been developed present a "variety of general truths about the universe". What is lacking is that each of them have not been assigned their proper "sphere of validity" through coordination. As philosophy progresses, we can see such coordination occurring gradually. In this sense, since Plato, philosophy has advanced since we can see a constant dialogue between the preceding and succeeding system where the benefits and disadvantages of each are laid out and examined.

The Problem of Overstatement
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>The main error in philosophy is overstatement. When systems tend to generalize, their aim is genuine- however, they overestimate their success. </p>
There are two forms of overstatement:
<ul list-style-type="circle">
<li>Fallacy of Misplaced Concreteness: A philosphical system suggests certain categories to characterise reality. Say, Plato proposed Forms, Aristotle proposed the category of Substance and Its Properties, Descartes introduced the categories of immaterial mind and material body. The fallacy of misplaced concreteness occurs when the system neglects the extent to which it has abstracted from the actuality when it develops its categories. Consider: to propose that only Forms are real or to say that the category of Substance and Its Properties or even those of Form and Matter capture the nature of reality as whole is to ignore certain "aspects of actualities". This fallacy would apply to any philosophical system which claims to represent the intrinsic nature or essence of reality through categories of thought. </li>
<li>False Estimate of Logical Procedure: 
<p>Philosophy believes that its method is to provide premises which are completely clear, distinct and certain and on these premises, to set up a deductive system of thought. </p>
<p>However, Whitehead says, that the purpose of philosophy is not to start with final generalities but to engage and develop them through discussion. He traces such a tendency for certainty to philosophy's mimicing of mathematics. He points out that even in mathematics, there are ultimate logical principles that face challenges. </p>
<p>Be aware that this does not mean that there can be no clarity or certainty. "The verification of a rationalistic scheme is to be sought in its general succes, and not in the pecuilar certainty or intitial clarity of its first principles." This means that a philosophical system can be evaluated through its application as a whole and not simply by judging the clarity of its first principles. Because philosophy seeks extreme clarity or certainty, <i> reductio ad absurdum </i> is abusively charged against many premises. In many cases, one can learn from such premises- however, claiming that they lead to absurd conclusions closes the avenue to learn anything from them. This marks the vitiation, loss of efficiency of philosophical reasoning. </p>
<p>When we face a contradiction in an argument, we can infer that one of the premises is at fault. However, unlike mathematics, it is not easy to spot such a faulty premise. Every premise has to be investigated and "is under suspicion". This shall be the case until we have a well-defined categoreal scheme of entities within a metaphysical system. </li></p>

Philosophical Scheme as a Matrix 
</th>
<tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>The objective of philosophy is to elaborate categoreal schemes which develop at every stage of its progress. At each such stage, there could be many rival schemes. Research will help to navigate through such differences. <i> "Metaphysical categories are not dogmatic statements of the obvious; they are tentative formulations of the ultimate generalities."</i></p>
<p>When we try to ask of any scheme of categories whether it is logically true or logically false, the answer will be that the scheme is false. Such an answer applies to principles of any science. This is because of the restricted scope of its validity that is neglected, owing to the fallacy of misplaced concreteness and the false estimate of logical procedure. We can say that a scheme is true <b> given</b> so-and-so qualifications, limitations, exceptions and new interpretations. As philosophy progresses, it will be possibe to situate this scheme as a logical truth. </p>
<p> Every categoreal scheme of a philosophical system is a "matrix from which true propositions applicable to particular circumstances can be derived." This means that under certain set of circumstances, the categories of the system will be rightly applicable. We must use our instincts and train them to be able to distinguish between those circumstances where the scheme will apply and where it will not. </p>
<p>When you develop a categoreal scheme within a philosophical system, then make sure you present the categories precisely. When this has been done and you have reached a conclusion, test it with experience. The precision and definiteness of a categoreal scheme trains your observational capacities and enables it to penetrate beyond the scope of common sense. When a categoreal scheme is tested in experience, there can be three outcomes: 
<ol>
<li>The conclusion agrees with the observed facts.</li>
<li>The conclusion exhibits a general (on-the-surface) agreement but there are disagreements in details.</li>
<li>The conclusion completely disagrees with the observed facts.</li>
</ol>
In case of the first outcome, the applicability of the scheme has been demonstrated. In case of the second outcome, both the observed facts and the conclusion have to be investigated further. In case of the third outcome, the theory has to be fundamentally reorganized. This can be done by either limiting its application to a very specific domain/province or one can abandon the system as a whole.

<th>
Experimental Adventure: Faculty of Poetic Insight and Imagination 
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p> Along with the faculty of reason and language, thought progresses also by poetic insight of the artists and through imagination where categories of a scheme can be played out as logical premises. "In some measure or other, progress is always a transcendence of what is obvious."</p>
<p>Rationalism is, at its core, an experimental adventure. It clarifies thought. Such a clarification is progressive and it is never final. However, every partial success we encounter on such an adventure is significant.
